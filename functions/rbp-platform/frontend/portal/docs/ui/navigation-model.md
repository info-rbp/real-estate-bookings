# Phase 1 Navigation Model

## Purpose

This document defines the Phase 1 navigation model for the Remote Business Partner application.

The goal is to create a clear route and navigation source of truth before deeper frontend implementation and later backend contract planning.

Phase 1 navigation should support:

- Public website navigation
- Footer navigation
- Utility navigation
- Mobile navigation
- Portal sidebar navigation
- Admin concept navigation
- Breadcrumb rules
- CTA rules
- Legacy redirect rules

This document is a planning and implementation reference. The matching TypeScript configuration lives in:

    src/app/config/navigation.ts
    src/app/config/redirects.ts

## Navigation Principles

The application should use navigation configuration rather than scattered hardcoded navigation arrays.

Navigation must be:

- Route-aware
- Mobile-friendly
- Consistent across desktop and mobile
- Friendly to future backend/admin management
- Safe for Phase 1 frontend-only implementation
- Free of real backend, auth, payment, upload, or Frappe dependencies

## Public Navigation

The public navigation should include:

    On-Demand Services
    Managed Services
    Applications
    Operations
    Marketplace
    Membership
    Offers
    Resources
    Help Center
    About Us

The logo should link to:

    /

Utility navigation should include:

    Search
    Contact
    Sign In
    Join Now

Join Now should point to:

    /membership/sign-up-now

Sign In should point to:

    /sign-in
