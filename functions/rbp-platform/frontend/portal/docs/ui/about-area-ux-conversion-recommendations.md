# About Area UX and Conversion Recommendations

## Purpose

This document defines the UX and conversion rules for the Remote Business Partner About Us area.

The About Us area should guide users into the right pathway:

- Learn who RBP is
- Understand the platform
- Book a discovery call
- Explore partnership opportunities
- Register interest in future roles
- Send a general enquiry

The goal is to reduce confusion, dead links, vague CTAs, and the classic website problem where every button leads to Contact Us because apparently information architecture was busy that day.

## Do Not Use

These patterns should be avoided:

| Bad Pattern | Reason |
|---|---|
| `/contact?reason=discovery-call` | Discovery Call now has a dedicated page. |
| `Our Platform -> /` | The platform explainer should not send users to the homepage. |
| Partnership CTA -> `/contact` | Partnership has a dedicated page. |
| Employment CTA -> `/contact` | Work For Us has a dedicated page. |
| Public copy mentioning mock forms | Public users do not need implementation caveats. |
| Public copy mentioning Phase 1 shell | This breaks trust and makes the product feel unfinished. |
