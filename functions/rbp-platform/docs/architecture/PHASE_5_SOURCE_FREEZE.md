# Phase 5 Source Freeze

## Status

info-rbp/rbp-platform on main is the only approved candidate source for Phase 5 Integration.

## Source of Truth

All Phase 5 work must start from:

    https://github.com/info-rbp/rbp-platform
    branch: main

## Old Repository Roles

The previous repositories are now reference/source-history repositories only.

| Repository | Phase Role | Phase 5 Role |
|---|---|---|
| info-rbp/Uiuxdesignassistance | Phase 1 UI/UX and Phase 2 contract source | Reference only |
| info-rbp/frappe-project | Phase 3 Frappe backend source | Reference only |
| info-rbp/rbp-platform | Phase 4 consolidation target | Active Phase 5 source of truth |

## Rules

- Do not begin Phase 5 work from Uiuxdesignassistance.
- Do not begin Phase 5 work from frappe-project.
- Do not copy whole source repositories back into rbp-platform.
- Do not re-import Frappe core.
- Do not commit generated files, local environment files, bench runtime files, secrets, node_modules, dist, or logs.
- Contract changes must be documented before integration code depends on them.
- Phase 5 branches must be created from rbp-platform/main.

## Required First Phase 5 Checks

Before implementation starts:

1. Run frontend install/build from frontend/portal.
2. Run backend syntax validation from apps/rbp_app.
3. Run Frappe install/migrate/test validation from a bench environment.
4. Compare frontend mock services against contracts/api/16-mock-to-real-api-map.md.
5. Compare routes against contracts/api/11-route-to-endpoint-map.md.

## Freeze Decision

Phase 5 may use rbp-platform/main as the starting point only after this document is merged.
