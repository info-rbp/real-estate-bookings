# RBP Phase 2 Backend Contracts
# 08-payment-state-model.md

## Document Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document | Payment State Model |
| Phase | Phase 2: Backend Contract Planning |
| Project | Remote Business Partner Platform |
| Status | Draft until Phase 1 UI/UX Completion |
| Intended Location Now | `RBP_Phase_2_Backend_Contracts/08-payment-state-model.md` |
| Intended Final Location | `rbp-platform/contracts/payments/payment-state-model.md` |
| Primary Consumers | Frappe backend, frontend, billing/admin operations, QA, integrations |

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the payment state model for the Remote Business Partner Platform.

It establishes:

```text
- canonical payment states
- subscription states
- payment event types
- payment lifecycle rules
- payment-to-workflow interactions
- payment-to-entitlement interactions
- payment-related DocTypes
- payment API expectations
- webhook/idempotency requirements
- frontend payment display rules
- admin reconciliation rules
- security/privacy requirements
- error handling requirements
- QA test requirements
```

This is a Phase 2 backend contract document. It does not implement payments. It defines how payment state must be modelled before Phase 3 Frappe implementation begins.

The purpose is to ensure payment behaviour is explicit, auditable, and not left to “whatever the checkout page felt like today,” which is how billing systems become small claims court with buttons.

---

## 2. Scope

This document applies to payment and billing behaviour across:

```text
Membership signup
Membership subscriptions
Service purchases, where applicable
Marketplace listing fees, where applicable
Connectivity / NBN orders, where applicable
Paid add-ons or entitlements
Payment provider webhooks
Payment event recording
Subscription lifecycle
Admin reconciliation
Frontend payment result screens
Portal billing summaries
Notifications
Audit logs
```

This document covers payment state modelling only.

It does not define:

```text
- final payment provider selection
- final provider API implementation
- final pricing/commercial model
- final tax/invoice implementation
- final accounting integration
```

Those can be layered on later. Apparently money needs its own ecosystem of paperwork because civilization was a mistake, but here we are.

## 4. Payment Model Principles

All payment modelling must follow these principles:

| Principle | Rule |
|---|---|
| Backend authority | Payment state must be controlled by backend/provider events, not frontend claims. |
| Provider-neutral model | Platform states must not be hardcoded to one payment provider. |
| Event-based recordkeeping | Payment changes must create `RBP Payment Event` records. |
| Idempotency | Duplicate provider events must not create duplicate business effects. |
| Auditability | Payment changes, failures, reconciliations, and overrides must be auditable. |
| Workflow-aware | Payment state may block or advance product workflows. |
| Entitlement-aware | Paid membership or add-ons must control entitlements. |
| Privacy-first | Raw payment payloads and provider details must be restricted. |
| Safe frontend | Frontend sees safe summaries, never raw provider payloads. |
| Admin reconciliation | Admins need controlled correction tools for real-world payment messiness. |
| No mystery money | Every paid action must map to a record, state, event, and audit trail. |

## 14. Payment API Standards

All payment APIs must use the standard response envelope.

## 14.1 Suggested Public/Auth APIs

```text
GET  /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.get_my_payment_summary
GET  /api/method/rbp_app.api.membership.get_subscription
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.membership.create_signup
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.create_checkout_session
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.cancel_checkout_session
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.retry_payment
```

## 14.2 Suggested Provider/System APIs

```text
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.handle_payment_webhook
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.record_payment_event
```

## 14.3 Suggested Admin APIs

```text
GET  /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.admin_list_payment_events
GET  /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.admin_get_payment_event
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.admin_reconcile_payment
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.admin_mark_payment_not_required
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.admin_record_refund
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.admin_suspend_subscription
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.billing.admin_restore_subscription
```

## 14.4 API Naming Rules

Use provider-neutral names.

Use:

```text
create_checkout_session
handle_payment_webhook
record_payment_event
admin_reconcile_payment
```

Do not use provider-specific names in contract-level APIs unless explicitly required:

```text
create_stripe_session
stripe_webhook
```

Provider-specific logic belongs in adapters/services, not the contract surface.

---

## 15. Payment API Response DTOs

## 15.1 Safe Payment Summary DTO

Customer-facing payment summaries may include:

```json
{
  "subscription_status": "active",
  "payment_status": "paid",

---

## 16. Webhook Handling Requirements

Payment provider webhook handling must be idempotent, safe, and auditable.

## 16.1 Webhook Processing Flow

```text
1. Receive webhook.
2. Verify provider signature/security.
3. Parse provider payload.
4. Determine provider_event_id.
5. Build idempotency_key.
6. Check if event already processed.
7. Map provider event to platform event_type.
8. Map provider payment state to platform status.
9. Create/update RBP Payment Event.
10. Update related subscription/product/workflow/entitlement if required.
11. Trigger notifications if required.
12. Record audit log.
13. Return safe response.
```

## 16.2 Idempotency Rules

```text
provider_event_id should be unique when provider supplies it.
idempotency_key should be generated when provider_event_id is unavailable.
Duplicate webhook must not duplicate subscription activation, entitlement grants, notifications, or audit records.
Duplicate webhook may be logged as webhook_duplicate.
```

## 16.3 Webhook Error Handling

Use standard error codes:

```text
payment_webhook_invalid
payment_webhook_signature_invalid
payment_webhook_duplicate
payment_provider_error
provider_response_invalid
```

## 16.4 Webhook Security

Webhook endpoints must:

```text
verify provider signature or equivalent
reject unsigned/invalid webhooks
avoid exposing detailed provider validation errors
log safe details with request_id
avoid customer-facing access
process idempotently
```

---

subscription_suspended
subscription_cancelled
subscription_expired
entitlement_activated
entitlement_suspended
entitlement_revoked
```

Audit events must capture:

```text
acting user or system actor
tenant
related_doctype
related_name
previous state
new state
event_type
provider_event_id, if safe
request_id
timestamp
reason, if admin action
```

## 20. Permission and Role Rules

## 20.1 Customer-Side Access

| Role | Payment Access |
|---|---|
| Guest | Public pricing only, no private payment events |
| Website User | Own pending checkout/payment result only |
| RBP Member | Own safe payment/subscription summary |
| RBP Business Owner | Tenant billing/subscription summary |
| RBP Team Member | No billing access by default |
| RBP Marketplace Seller | Own listing fee/payment summary if applicable |
| RBP Marketplace Buyer | Own enquiry/purchase summary if applicable |

## 20.2 Internal/Admin Access

| Role | Payment Access |
|---|---|
| RBP Advisor | No payment access by default |
| RBP Support Agent | Conditional safe billing support access |
| RBP Admin | Operational payment event and reconciliation access |
| System Manager | Full payment configuration/event access |
| Administrator | Full technical access |

## 20.3 Restricted Fields

These fields must not be exposed to customer users:

```text
raw_payload
provider secrets
provider API response internals
internal reconciliation notes
fraud/dispute details unless deliberately customer-facing
full webhook verification details
```

---

## 21. Security and Privacy Requirements

Payment handling must follow these rules:

```text
Frontend must not set payment state.
Frontend must not set subscription state.
Frontend must not activate entitlements.
Raw payment payloads must be restricted.
Provider secrets must never be returned by APIs.
Webhook signature verification must be enforced.
Duplicate provider events must be idempotent.
Payment state changes must be auditable.
Customer users must only see safe payment summaries.
Cross-tenant payment access must be denied.
Admin reconciliation must require reason and audit log.
```

## 21.1 Sensitive Data Rule

Do not store or expose card data unless the chosen payment provider and compliance model explicitly require it.

The platform should prefer provider-hosted/payment-token flows where sensitive card details remain with the provider.

---

## 22. Frontend Payment Contract

The frontend must treat payment state as backend-provided state.

## 22.1 Frontend Responsibilities

```text
Display pricing and selected plan.
Start checkout/payment flow through backend API.
Show pending/success/failure states from backend response.
Poll or refresh payment summary if needed.
Handle payment_required, payment_pending, and payment_failed errors.
Never directly mark records as paid.
Never activate entitlements locally.
Never unlock product access based only on a client-side redirect.
```

## 22.2 Frontend UI States

| UI State | Backend Source |
|---|---|
| Payment not required | `payment_status = not_required` |
| Payment pending | `payment_status = pending` or workflow `Payment Pending` |
| Payment authorised | `payment_status = authorised` |
| Payment successful | `payment_status = paid` |
| Payment failed | `payment_status = failed` |
| Payment cancelled | `payment_status = cancelled` |
| Refunded | `payment_status = refunded` |
| Disputed / under review | `payment_status = disputed` |

## 22.3 Payment Result Screens

Payment result pages must verify backend state.

Do not assume success from:

```text
success URL redirect
query parameter
client-side checkout callback
local mock state
```

Use backend confirmation endpoint or payment summary endpoint.

---

## 23. API Error Requirements

Payment APIs must use standard error codes from `07-error-catalogue.md`.

Key payment errors:

```text
payment_required
payment_pending
payment_failed
payment_cancelled
payment_disputed
payment_not_found
payment_already_processed
payment_provider_error
payment_provider_unavailable
payment_provider_timeout
payment_webhook_invalid
payment_webhook_signature_invalid
payment_webhook_duplicate
subscription_required
subscription_not_found
subscription_inactive
subscription_cancelled
billing_account_required
invalid_payment_state
raw_payment_payload_restricted
```

## 23.1 Example: Payment Required

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "data": null,
  "message": "Payment required",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "payment_status",
      "code": "payment_required",
      "message": "Payment must be completed before this request can proceed."
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

## 23.2 Example: Duplicate Webhook

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "data": null,
  "message": "Payment webhook already processed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": null,
      "code": "payment_webhook_duplicate",
      "message": "Payment webhook has already been processed."
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

## 24. Frappe Implementation Notes

Recommended backend structure:

```text
rbp_app/
└── rbp_app/
    ├── api/
    │   └── billing.py
    ├── services/
    │   ├── billing.py
    │   ├── entitlements.py
    │   ├── notifications.py
    │   └── audit.py
    ├── integrations/
    │   └── payments/
    │       ├── base.py
    │       ├── stripe.py
    │       └── manual.py
    ├── doctype/
    │   ├── rbp_payment_event/
    │   ├── rbp_subscription/
    │   └── rbp_app_entitlement/
    ├── permissions.py
    ├── guards.py
    └── hooks.py
```

## 24.1 Service-Layer Function Examples

```python
def create_checkout_session(user: str, payload: dict):
    ...

def handle_payment_webhook(provider: str, headers: dict, payload: dict):
    ...

def record_payment_event(provider: str, event: dict):
    ...

def map_provider_event_to_payment_state(provider: str, event: dict) -> str:
    ...

def activate_subscription_from_payment(payment_event: str):
    ...

def update_entitlements_from_subscription(subscription: str):
    ...

def reconcile_payment(user: str, payload: dict):
    ...

def get_safe_payment_summary(user: str):
    ...
```

## 24.2 Adapter Pattern

Payment provider logic should use adapters:

```text
PaymentProviderAdapter
  ├── create_checkout_session
  ├── verify_webhook
  ├── parse_event
  ├── map_event_type
  ├── map_payment_state
  └── build_safe_reference
```

This keeps provider-specific chaos out of the platform contract, which is the closest software gets to hygiene.

---

## 25. Mock-to-Real Payment Mapping

Phase 1 mock payment fields must map into real payment records or provider flows.

| Mock Field / State | Real Mapping |
|---|---|
| `payment_method_mock` | Provider checkout/session/payment method token |
| `payment_simulated_success` | `RBP Payment Event` with `status = paid` in mock/test only |
| `payment_simulated_failure` | `RBP Payment Event` with `status = failed` in mock/test only |
| `payment_pending` | `RBP Payment Event.status = pending` |
| `membership_active` | `RBP Subscription.status = active` and entitlements active |
| `listing_fee_mock` | `RBP Payment Event` linked to `RBP Marketplace Listing` |
| `serviceability_status_mock` | Not payment, maps to Connectivity Order serviceability |
| `payment_required` | Product/workflow rule plus payment event requirement |

Mock-only payment states must not become production truth.

---

## 26. Validation Rules

Payment-related validation must include:

```text
payment_provider is required for payment events.
status is required for payment events.
event_type is required for payment events.
amount must be >= 0 when provided.
currency is required when amount is provided.
provider_event_id should be unique when present.
idempotency_key should be unique when present.
related_doctype and related_name must both be valid when linking payment to a record.
Subscription must have tenant, member, and plan.
Subscription status must be valid.
Entitlement activation must match subscription/payment rules.
Admin reconciliation requires a reason.
Webhook processing requires signature verification when provider supports it.
```

---

## 27. Indexing Requirements

Recommended indexes for payment-related DocTypes:

```text
RBP Payment Event:
  tenant
  user
  related_doctype
  related_name
  payment_provider
  provider_event_id
  provider_customer_id
  provider_payment_id
  provider_subscription_id
  status
  event_type
  processed_on
  idempotency_key
  reconciliation_status

RBP Subscription:
  tenant
  member
  plan
  status
  payment_provider
  provider_customer_id
  provider_subscription_id
  current_period_end

RBP App Entitlement:
  tenant
  user
  app_key
  status
  source_subscription
  ends_on
```

---

## 28. Reporting Requirements

Admin/billing views should eventually support:

```text
payment event list
failed payments
pending payments
disputed payments
refunded payments
subscription status list
past due subscriptions
suspended subscriptions
entitlement activation failures
payment events needing reconciliation
provider webhook failures
```

Recommended filters:

```text
tenant
user
payment_provider
status
event_type
processed_from
processed_to
amount_min
amount_max
currency
reconciliation_status
related_doctype
related_name
```

---

## 32. Phase 2 Sign-Off Criteria

This Payment State Model can be signed off only when:

```text
Every payment touchpoint from Phase 1 has a backend payment rule.
Every paid flow maps to RBP Payment Event.
Every subscription flow maps to RBP Subscription.
Every entitlement effect maps to RBP App Entitlement.
Every payment-dependent workflow defines pending/success/failure behaviour.
Every payment error maps to the Error Catalogue.
Every payment notification maps to the Notification Trigger contract.
Every admin reconciliation action is defined.
Every customer-facing payment summary excludes restricted fields.
Every provider webhook requirement is defined.
Every mock payment state maps to a real payment model.
Every payment QA test has an expected state, event, and response.
```

Until then, this remains a draft.

---

## 33. Final Rule

Money is not a boolean.

Payment state must answer:

```text
What was attempted?
Who attempted it?
What provider handled it?
What record did it relate to?
What happened?
Was it already processed?
What workflow did it block or unlock?
What entitlement did it grant, suspend, or revoke?
Who was notified?
What was audited?
```

If the system cannot answer those questions, it does not have payment handling. It has accounting-flavoured optimism.
