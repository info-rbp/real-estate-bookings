## Document Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document | Upload / File Rules |
| Phase | Phase 2: Backend Contract Planning |
| Project | Remote Business Partner Platform |
| Status | Draft until Phase 1 UI/UX Completion |
| Intended Location Now | `RBP_Phase_2_Backend_Contracts/09-upload-file-rules.md` |
| Intended Final Location | `rbp-platform/contracts/files/upload-file-rules.md` |
| Primary Consumers | Frappe backend, frontend, QA, admin operations, security review |

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the upload and file-handling rules for the Remote Business Partner Platform.

It establishes:

```text
- which product flows allow uploads
- how uploaded files are stored
- how uploaded files relate to Frappe File
- how files link to business records
- file ownership rules
- tenant visibility rules
- allowed visibility states
- allowed file types
- size and count limits
- upload API contracts
- file access rules
- workflow-state upload rules
- public media rules
- admin file actions
- file-related notifications
- audit logging
- error handling
- frontend mock-to-real mapping
- QA and security requirements
```

This is a Phase 2 backend contract document. It does not implement file handling. It defines the rules Phase 3 Frappe implementation must follow.

The purpose is to stop uploaded files from becoming “miscellaneous blobs with vibes,” which is how platforms accidentally publish private PDFs to the internet and then pretend it was a feature.

---

## 2. Scope

This document applies to all file upload and file reference behaviour across:

```text
Decision Desk
DocuShare
Marketplace
Connectivity / NBN
Risk Advisor
The Fixer
Membership / business profile, if documents are required
Portal documents
Admin uploads
Advisor/support uploads
Customer supporting documents
Marketplace listing media
Generated outcome files
Payment or billing evidence, if used
```

This document covers:

```text
RBP File Reference
Frappe File linkage
file visibility
upload permissions
download/view permissions
workflow-state upload rules
file validation
file security
file metadata
file audit events
file notification triggers
file API contracts
frontend upload behaviour
mock-to-real mapping
QA tests
```

This document does not define final storage infrastructure. It assumes Frappe File is the base file object and `RBP File Reference` wraps it with platform-specific ownership, tenant, visibility, and related-record rules.

---

## 4. File Handling Principles

All file handling must follow these principles:

| Principle | Rule |
|---|---|
| Frappe File is not enough | Every business-relevant file must have an `RBP File Reference`. |
| Tenant-scoped by default | Files linked to customer/business records must be tenant-aware. |
| Private by default | Uploaded files must default to non-public visibility unless explicitly approved. |
| Related-record required | Files must be linked to a valid business record, except controlled temporary upload flows. |
| Backend authority | File visibility, ownership, and access must be enforced server-side. |
| No raw public URLs by accident | Public exposure must be deliberate, approved, and auditable. |
| Workflow-aware | Upload and view permissions may depend on workflow state. |
| Role-aware | Customers, advisors, support, and admins have different file permissions. |
| Audit-sensitive | Attachments, visibility changes, removals, quarantine, and public publishing must be audited. |
| Safe frontend | Frontend must show only files returned by backend-authorised APIs. |
| Mock files must map cleanly | Phase 1 mock upload fields must map into real file references before integration. |

---

## 5. Core DocType: RBP File Reference

## 5.1 Purpose

`RBP File Reference` links a Frappe `File` to an RBP business record with platform-specific rules for:

```text
tenant
owner
related record
visibility
file type
upload source
status
permissions
audit
workflow context
```

The Frappe `File` object stores the file. `RBP File Reference` defines how the platform is allowed to use it.

## 5.2 Required Fields

| Fieldname | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `tenant` | Link: RBP Tenant | Conditional | Required for tenant/customer records |

## 6. File Visibility Values

Visibility values must use lowercase snake_case in APIs.

| Frappe Label | API Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Private to Owner | `private_to_owner` | Visible only to uploader/owner and authorised admins. |
| Tenant Visible | `tenant_visible` | Visible to authorised users in the same tenant. |
| Advisor Visible | `advisor_visible` | Visible to assigned advisor/support/admin users. |
| Admin Only | `admin_only` | Visible only to authorised internal/admin roles. |
| Public | `public` | Publicly visible or available through public-facing UI. |

## 6.1 Default Visibility Rules

| Upload Context | Default Visibility |
|---|---|
| Customer supporting document | `private_to_owner` |
| Customer tenant/business document | `tenant_visible`, if intended for tenant team visibility |
| Customer response to More Information Required | `tenant_visible` or product-specific |
| Advisor working file | `advisor_visible` |
| Admin internal file | `admin_only` |
| Payment/billing evidence | `admin_only` |
| Marketplace listing media before approval | `private_to_owner` or `admin_only` |
| Marketplace listing media after publication approval | `public` |
| Final customer-facing outcome document | `tenant_visible`, unless product requires narrower visibility |

## 6.2 Visibility Rules

```text
Visibility must be explicitly set.
If visibility is missing, default to the safest available value.
Public visibility must require explicit product rule or admin approval.
Customer users must not directly set files to public.
Admin visibility changes must be audited.
```

---

## 7. File Lifecycle States

File reference status values:

| Frappe Label | API Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Active | `active` | File is active and available according to visibility rules. |
| Removed | `removed` | File has been removed or hidden from normal use. |
| Quarantined | `quarantined` | File is blocked due to security or policy concern. |
| Archived | `archived` | File is retained historically but not active. |

## 7.1 Lifecycle Rules

```text
Uploaded files usually start as Active.
Files may start as Quarantined if scan/security checks fail.
Removed files should not be shown in normal user views.
Archived files should be retained for audit/history.
Quarantined files must not be downloadable by customer users.
```

---

## 8. File Type Categories

Business-level file type values should describe the file’s role, not just its extension.

Approved file type categories:

```text
supporting_document
reference_document
business_document
identity_or_registration_document
marketplace_media
listing_image
listing_attachment
payment_evidence
serviceability_document
assessment_evidence
advisor_working_file
recommendation_document
outcome_document
admin_internal_document
other
```

## 8.1 Product-Specific Examples

| Product | Common File Types |
|---|---|
| Decision Desk | `supporting_document`, `reference_document`, `recommendation_document` |
| DocuShare | `reference_document`, `business_document`, `outcome_document` |
| Marketplace | `marketplace_media`, `listing_image`, `listing_attachment` |
| Connectivity | `serviceability_document`, `payment_evidence`, `supporting_document` |

## 9. Allowed File Extensions and MIME Types

Final allowed types must be confirmed during final Phase 2 lock. Draft defaults:

## 9.1 Documents

| Extension | MIME Type | Allowed |
|---|---|---:|
| `.pdf` | `application/pdf` | Yes |
| `.doc` | `application/msword` | Conditional |
| `.docx` | `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document` | Yes |
| `.xls` | `application/vnd.ms-excel` | Conditional |
| `.xlsx` | `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet` | Yes |
| `.csv` | `text/csv` | Conditional |
| `.txt` | `text/plain` | Conditional |
| `.rtf` | `application/rtf` | Conditional |

## 9.2 Images

| Extension | MIME Type | Allowed |
|---|---|---:|
| `.jpg` | `image/jpeg` | Yes |
| `.jpeg` | `image/jpeg` | Yes |
| `.png` | `image/png` | Yes |
| `.webp` | `image/webp` | Conditional |
| `.gif` | `image/gif` | Conditional |
| `.svg` | `image/svg+xml` | No by default |

## 9.3 Archives

| Extension | MIME Type | Allowed |
|---|---|---:|
| `.zip` | `application/zip` | No by default |
| `.rar` | `application/vnd.rar` | No |
| `.7z` | `application/x-7z-compressed` | No |

## 9.4 Executables and Scripts

These must be blocked by default:

```text
.exe
.bat
.cmd
.sh
.ps1
.js
.mjs
.vbs
.scr
.dll
.app
.dmg
.pkg
.jar
.php
.py
.rb
.pl
```

### 9.5 File Type Rule

Validation must check both:

```text
file extension
MIME type / detected content type
```

Do not trust only the filename extension. A file called `invoice.pdf.exe` is not a PDF. Humanity keeps trying this.

---

## 10. File Size and Count Limits

Final limits must be confirmed during final Phase 2 lock. Draft defaults:

| Context | Max File Size | Max Files Per Record | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| General supporting documents | 25 MB | 10 | Decision Desk, Fixer, Risk Advisor |
| DocuShare reference files | 25 MB | 20 | May need higher count |
| Marketplace listing images | 10 MB | 12 | Images/media |
| Marketplace listing attachments | 25 MB | 5 | Non-image docs |
| Connectivity order documents | 25 MB | 10 | Service/provisioning |
| Payment evidence | 10 MB | 5 | Admin/customer if enabled |
| Admin internal files | 50 MB | 20 | Admin-only |
| Generated outcome documents | 50 MB | 10 | Advisor/admin |

## 10.1 Size Rules

```text
Backend must enforce file size limits.
Frontend should show limits before upload.
Backend remains authoritative.
Oversized files must return file_too_large.
```

## 10.2 Count Rules

```text
Backend must enforce max file count per related record and file type.
Removed or archived files may or may not count depending on product rule.
max_files_exceeded must be returned when count is exceeded.
```

---

## 11. Upload-Supporting Product Flows

Uploads may be required or optional depending on final UI flow.

| Product / Flow | Upload Support | Typical Upload Fields |
|---|---:|---|
| Membership | Conditional | Business registration, billing evidence, onboarding docs |
| Decision Desk | Yes | Supporting documents, evidence, option references |
| DocuShare | Yes | Reference documents, source material, draft docs |
| Marketplace Listing | Yes | Images, media, listing attachments |

| Risk Advisor | Yes | Assessment evidence, policies, incident docs |
| The Fixer | Yes | Problem evidence, screenshots, documents |
| Portal Documents | Yes | User-visible generated/shared files |
| Admin Operations | Yes | Internal/admin files, outcome files |

---

## 12. Mock-to-Real Upload Mapping

Phase 1 mock upload fields must map into `RBP File Reference`.

| Phase 1 Mock Field | Real Backend Mapping |
|---|---|
| `supporting_documents_mock` | `RBP File Reference` linked to product record |
| `reference_files_mock` | `RBP File Reference` linked to `RBP Document Brief` |
| `media_mock` | `RBP File Reference` linked to `RBP Marketplace Listing` |
| `payment_evidence_mock` | `RBP File Reference` linked to payment/billing record |
| `serviceability_documents_mock` | `RBP File Reference` linked to `RBP Connectivity Order` |
| `assessment_evidence_mock` | `RBP File Reference` linked to `RBP Risk Assessment` |
| `fixer_supporting_documents_mock` | `RBP File Reference` linked to `RBP Fixer Request` |

## 12.1 Mock Mapping Rules

```text
Mock files do not represent real persistence.
Mock file arrays must be replaced by upload APIs in Phase 5.
Each real uploaded file must create both a Frappe File and an RBP File Reference.
Mock-only fields should not remain in production DTOs.
```

---

## 13. Upload API Standards

All upload APIs must use the standard response envelope.

## 13.1 Generic Upload Pattern

```text
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.<domain>.attach_file
```

Examples:

```text
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.decision_desk.attach_file
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.docushare.attach_file
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.marketplace.attach_file
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.connectivity.attach_file
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.risk_advisor.attach_file
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.fixer.attach_file
```

## 13.2 Shared File APIs

```text
GET  /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.get_file_reference
GET  /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.list_files_for_record
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.remove_file_reference
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.admin_change_visibility
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.admin_quarantine_file
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.admin_restore_file
```

## 13.3 Upload Request Fields

Upload APIs should receive or resolve:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `related_doctype` | Yes | Target DocType |
| `related_name` | Yes | Target record |
| `file` | Yes | Uploaded file payload / Frappe upload handle |
| `file_type` | Conditional | Business file type |
| `description` | Conditional | Optional description |
| `visibility` | Conditional | Backend may override default |
| `source_channel` | Conditional | Website, portal, admin, API |

## 13.4 Upload Response Example

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "file_reference": {
      "name": "RBP-FILE-0001",
      "related_doctype": "RBP Decision Desk Request",
      "related_name": "RBP-DDR-0001",
      "file_type": "supporting_document",
      "visibility": "private_to_owner",
      "status": "active",
      "original_filename": "financial-summary.pdf",
      "file_size_bytes": 1048576,
      "uploaded_on": "2026-05-07T00:00:00Z"
    }
  },
  "message": "File uploaded",
  "errors": [],
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "uuid",
    "timestamp": "2026-05-07T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## 13.5 List Files Response Example

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "files": [
      {
        "name": "RBP-FILE-0001",
        "file_type": "supporting_document",
        "visibility": "private_to_owner",
        "status": "active",
        "original_filename": "financial-summary.pdf",
        "file_size_bytes": 1048576,
        "uploaded_on": "2026-05-07T00:00:00Z",
        "can_view": true,
        "can_remove": true,
        "download_url": "/api/method/rbp_app.api.files.download?file_reference=RBP-FILE-0001"
      }
    ]
  },
  "message": "Files loaded",
  "errors": [],
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

## 13.6 Download/View API Rule

Download URLs must be permission-checked.

Do not expose direct Frappe file URLs for private files unless Frappe access controls are guaranteed and tested.

Recommended pattern:

```text
GET /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.download?file_reference=<name>
```

This endpoint must:

```text
resolve file reference
check user permission
check related record permission
check visibility
check status
stream or redirect safely
audit sensitive access if required
```

---

## 14. Upload Permission Rules

A user may upload a file only when all of the following are true:

```text
user is authenticated, unless public upload is explicitly allowed
related_doctype is allowed for uploads
related_name exists
user can access the related record
user can attach files to the related record
related record workflow state allows uploads
file type is allowed
file size is within limit
file count limit is not exceeded
visibility is allowed for the user's role
```

## 14.1 Role-Based Upload Rules

| Role | Upload Authority |
|---|---|
| Guest | No uploads by default; public form uploads only if explicitly whitelisted |
| Website User | Own draft/authenticated intake records only |
| RBP Member | Own or tenant-authorised records |
| RBP Business Owner | Tenant-authorised records |
| RBP Team Member | Conditional tenant-authorised records |
| RBP Advisor | Assigned records only, usually advisor/internal/outcome files |
| RBP Marketplace Seller | Own listings |
| RBP Marketplace Buyer | Own enquiries if buyer uploads are enabled |
| RBP Support Agent | Assigned/queue records where permitted |
| RBP Admin | Full operational upload access |
| System Manager | Full system access |
| Administrator | Full access |

## 14.2 Upload Denial Examples

Return `file_attach_denied` when:

```text
record does not support uploads
user cannot access record
workflow state blocks upload
user role cannot upload to that record
file is being attached to another tenant's record
```

Return `upload_not_allowed_in_state` when:

```text
record is Closed, Cancelled, Archived, or otherwise locked for upload
```

---

## 15. File View / Download Permission Rules

A user may view or download a file only when all of the following are true:

```text
file reference exists
file reference status allows viewing
user has access to related record
visibility permits the user's role/context
tenant matches or an authorised internal exception applies
file is not quarantined
file is not removed
```

## 15.1 Visibility Access Matrix

| Visibility | Guest | Website User | RBP Member | Business Owner | Team Member | Advisor | Support Agent | RBP Admin | System Manager |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `public` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `private_to_owner` | No | Owner only | Owner only | Owner/Tenant policy | Owner/conditional | No | Conditional | Yes | Yes |
| `tenant_visible` | No | No | Tenant | Tenant | Conditional | No | Conditional | Yes | Yes |
| `advisor_visible` | No | No | Conditional | Conditional | No | Assigned | Conditional | Yes | Yes |
| `admin_only` | No | No | No | No | No | No | Conditional | Yes | Yes |

## 15.2 Safe Not Found Rule

If a user attempts to access a file from another tenant, backend may return:

```text
file_not_found
```

instead of:

```text
file_access_denied
```

when revealing file existence would leak information.

---

## 16. Workflow-State Upload Rules

Upload availability depends on the related record’s workflow state.

| Workflow State | Customer Upload | Advisor/Support Upload | Admin Upload |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Draft | Yes, if product supports uploads | No | Yes |
| Payment Pending | Conditional | No | Yes |
| Payment Failed | Conditional | No | Yes |
| Submitted | Conditional supplemental upload | Conditional | Yes |
| In Review | Conditional if requested | Yes, internal/admin depending on role | Yes |
| More Information Required | Yes, requested files | Yes | Yes |
| Assigned | Conditional | Yes | Yes |
| In Progress | Conditional | Yes | Yes |
| Outcome Ready | No, unless clarification/dispute flow | Yes, outcome files | Yes |
| Closed | No | No, unless admin reopened | Admin only |
| Rejected | No, unless resubmission allowed | No | Admin only |
| Cancelled | No | No | Admin only |
| Archived | No | No | Admin/system only |

## 16.1 State Rule

When upload is blocked by workflow state, return:

```text
upload_not_allowed_in_state
```

or:

```text
record_locked
```

depending on the context.

System/security scanner
```

Effects:

```text
status = quarantined
normal download blocked
customer visibility blocked

removed from active lists
retained for history/audit
restorable only by authorised admin/system action
```

## 20. File Naming and Metadata Rules

## 20.1 Original Filename

The original filename may be stored for user display:

```text
original_filename
```

It must be sanitised before display.

## 20.2 Stored Filename

Stored filenames should be normalised or generated to avoid collisions and unsafe characters.

Recommended pattern:

```text
<doctype_slug>-<record_name>-<uuid>.<extension>
```

Example:

```text
decision-desk-rbp-ddr-0001-550e8400.pdf
```

## 20.3 Filename Safety

Filenames must be sanitised to prevent:

```text
path traversal
script injection
HTML injection
special-character issues
duplicate overwrite
misleading extensions
```

Block or normalise filenames containing:

```text
../
..\
null bytes
HTML tags
control characters
extreme length
```

## 20.4 Metadata Rules

Metadata must not expose:

```text
private server paths
storage provider secrets
temporary signed URLs beyond intended use
internal virus scan details to unauthorised users
```

---

## 21. Security Requirements

File handling must satisfy these security requirements:

```text
No public exposure of private files.
No cross-tenant file access.
No unauthorised file downloads.
No customer access to admin_only files.
No customer access to raw storage paths.
No executable/script uploads by default.
No SVG uploads by default unless sanitised.
No direct trust in file extension alone.
No upload to locked records unless admin-authorised.
No public marketplace media before approval/publication.
Quarantined files must be blocked from normal access.
File visibility changes must be audited.
Private file download endpoints must perform backend permission checks.
```

## 21.1 Malware / Content Scanning

Final scanning provider is not defined in this draft.

Draft rule:

```text
If malware/content scanning is enabled, files may begin with scan_status = Pending.
Files failing scan must be marked Quarantined.
Quarantined files must not be downloadable by customer users.
Admin/security review must be required.
```

## 21.2 Sensitive Document Handling

Sensitive document types include:

```text
business registration documents
identity documents
financial documents
payment evidence
risk assessment evidence
contracts/legal documents
admin internal documents
```

These should default to:

```text
private_to_owner
tenant_visible
admin_only
```

not:

```text
public
```

A magnificent discovery, apparently.

---

## 22. Frontend Upload Contract

Frontend upload components must support:

```text
file type restrictions
file size guidance
max file count guidance
upload progress
upload success state
upload failure state
retry handling
remove file action
file list display
file visibility display, where appropriate
locked upload state
requested-file upload state
admin-only/public warnings where appropriate
```

## 22.1 Frontend Must Not

```text
assume uploaded file is visible before backend confirms
assume file is public because listing is public
assume mock file arrays are real persistence
expose direct private file URLs
allow customer users to set public visibility
hide security failures behind generic messages
```

## 22.2 Recommended Frontend File DTO

```ts
export type FileReferenceDto = {
  name: string;
  related_doctype: string;
  related_name: string;
  file_type: string;
  visibility: "private_to_owner" | "tenant_visible" | "advisor_visible" | "admin_only" | "public";
  status: "active" | "removed" | "quarantined" | "archived";
  original_filename: string;
  file_size_bytes: number;
  uploaded_on: string;
  uploaded_by?: string;
  can_view: boolean;
  can_remove: boolean;
  download_url?: string;
};
```

---

## 23. Error Handling

File APIs must use standard errors from `07-error-catalogue.md`.

Key file errors:

```text
file_required
file_not_found
file_too_large
file_empty
unsupported_file_type
file_upload_failed
file_attach_denied
file_visibility_denied
file_visibility_invalid
file_access_denied
file_quarantined
file_removed
max_files_exceeded
upload_not_allowed_in_state
public_file_requires_approval
```

## 23.1 Example: Unsupported File Type

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "data": null,
  "message": "File upload failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "supporting_documents",
      "code": "unsupported_file_type",
      "message": "This file type is not supported."
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

## 23.2 Example: Upload Not Allowed in State

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "data": null,
  "message": "Upload not allowed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "workflow_state",
      "code": "upload_not_allowed_in_state",
      "message": "Files cannot be uploaded while this record is in its current state."
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

## 23.3 Example: File Access Denied

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "data": null,
  "message": "File access denied",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": null,
      "code": "file_access_denied",
      "message": "You do not have access to this file."
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

---

## 24. Notifications

File-related notification triggers should be used where the file action is user-actionable or operationally important.

Potential triggers:

| Trigger | Recipient | When |
|---|---|---|
| `file_uploaded` | Admin/support optional | Customer uploads file to submitted/review record |
| `supporting_document_uploaded` | Admin/support | Supporting document added |
| `more_information_file_uploaded` | Admin/support/advisor | Customer responds to More Information Required |
| `outcome_document_uploaded` | Customer | Outcome/final file shared |
| `marketplace_media_uploaded` | Admin | Seller uploads listing media |
| `marketplace_media_approved_public` | Seller/admin | Media becomes public |
| `file_visibility_changed` | Admin/security | Visibility changed |
| `file_quarantined` | Admin/security | File quarantined |
| `file_removed` | User/admin depending on context | File removed |

Notification rules must be finalised in:

```text
14-notification-triggers.md
```

---

## 25. Audit Events

File handling must create audit logs for sensitive actions.

Audit event keys:

```text
file_attached
file_uploaded
file_viewed
file_downloaded
file_removed
file_archived
file_restored
file_quarantined
file_scan_failed
file_visibility_changed
file_public_approved
file_access_denied
```

## 25.1 Audit Event Data

Audit events should record:

```text
acting user or system actor
tenant
related_doctype
related_name
file_reference
file
previous_visibility, if changed
new_visibility, if changed
previous_status, if changed
new_status, if changed
source_channel
request_id
timestamp
reason, if admin action
```

## 25.2 File View/Download Auditing

Not every file view/download must create a high-volume audit entry by default.

Audit downloads for:

```text
admin_only files
payment evidence
identity/business registration documents
quarantined access attempts
cross-tenant denied attempts
public visibility changes
final outcome documents, if required by policy
```

---

## 26. Admin File Actions

Admin file actions must be explicit.

Recommended admin APIs:

```text
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.admin_change_visibility
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.admin_quarantine_file
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.admin_restore_file
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.admin_remove_file_reference
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.admin_approve_public_file
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.files.admin_archive_file
```

## 26.1 Admin Action Requirements

Every admin file action must validate:

```text
admin role
target file reference exists
related record access
current status
requested status/visibility
reason, where required
public eligibility, where applicable
audit event creation
notification trigger, where applicable
```

## 26.2 Public Approval Action

`admin_approve_public_file` must require:

```text
file_reference
reason or approval note
confirmation that related record is public-eligible
confirmation that file type is public-eligible
confirmation that record workflow state allows public visibility
```

---

## 27. Frappe Implementation Notes

## 27.1 Service-Layer Function Examples

```python
def attach_file(user: str, payload: dict, file_obj):
    ...

def create_file_reference(user: str, file_doc: str, payload: dict):
    ...

def list_files_for_record(user: str, doctype: str, name: str):

    ...

def can_view_file(user: str, file_reference: str) -> bool:
    ...

def can_attach_file(user: str, doctype: str, name: str) -> bool:
    ...

def change_file_visibility(user: str, file_reference: str, visibility: str, reason: str):
    ...

def quarantine_file(user: str, file_reference: str, reason: str):
    ...

def remove_file_reference(user: str, file_reference: str, reason: str | None = None):
    ...
```

## 27.2 Guard Functions

```python
require_file_upload_allowed(user, related_doctype, related_name)
require_file_view_allowed(user, file_reference)
require_file_visibility_change_allowed(user, file_reference, visibility)
require_file_admin_action(user, action, file_reference)
```

## 27.3 Implementation Rules

```text
Do not modify Frappe core.
Use Frappe File for actual stored file.
Use RBP File Reference for platform business rules.
Use service layer for permission/visibility checks.
Use API methods as thin wrappers.
Use standard response envelope.
Use standard error catalogue.
```

---

## 28. Validation Rules

Upload validation must include:

```text
related_doctype is required.
related_name is required.
related record must exist.
user must have access to related record.
user must be allowed to attach files to related record.
workflow state must permit upload.
file is required.
file must not be empty.
file extension must be allowed.
file MIME/content type must be allowed.
file size must be within limit.
file count must not exceed product/record limit.
file_type must be allowed for the product/record.
visibility must be allowed for the user's role.
public visibility must require approval.
tenant must match related record.
```

File reference validation must include:

```text
owner is required.
uploaded_by is required.
uploaded_on is required.
file is required.
status is required.
visibility is required.
related_doctype and related_name are required.
```

---

## 29. Indexing Requirements

Recommended indexes for `RBP File Reference`:

```text
tenant
owner
related_doctype
related_name
file
file_type
visibility
status
uploaded_by
uploaded_on
approved_for_public_on
scan_status
```

List APIs will commonly filter by:

```text
related_doctype
related_name
tenant
owner
file_type
visibility
status
uploaded_from
uploaded_to
```

---

## 30. Reporting and Admin Review Requirements

Admin views should eventually support:

```text
files by tenant
files by product record
admin_only files
public files
quarantined files
removed files
large files
files pending scan
files with failed scan
marketplace media pending public approval
files uploaded during More Information Required
payment evidence files
```

Recommended filters:

```text
tenant
related_doctype
related_name
file_type
visibility
status
uploaded_by
uploaded_from
uploaded_to
scan_status
approved_for_public_by
```

Until then, this remains a draft.

---

## 35. Final Rule

A file is not just a file.

On this platform, every uploaded file must answer:

```text
Who uploaded it?
Who owns it?
Which tenant does it belong to?
Which record is it attached to?
What type of file is it?
Who can see it?
Can it ever be public?
What state was the record in when uploaded?
Can it be removed?
Can it be downloaded?
Was it scanned?
Was it audited?
```

If the system cannot answer those questions, the file does not belong in production. It belongs in a cautionary tale with a postmortem attached.
