## Document Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document | Permission Model Draft |
| Phase | Phase 2: Backend Contract Planning |
| Project | Remote Business Partner Platform |
| Status | Draft until Phase 1 UI/UX Completion |
| Intended Location Now | `RBP_Phase_2_Backend_Contracts/04-permission-model-draft.md` |
| Intended Final Location | `rbp-platform/contracts/permissions/permission-model.md` |
| Primary Consumers | Frappe backend, frontend, QA, admin operations, security review |

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the draft permission model for the Remote Business Partner Platform.

It translates the role matrix into enforceable backend rules covering:

```text
- authentication
- role checks
- tenant isolation
- ownership
- team access
- advisor assignment
- support/admin access
- entitlements
- workflow state rules
- file visibility
- payment visibility
- notification visibility
- admin actions
- API access
- DocType access
- field-level access
- QA permission tests
```

This is a Phase 2 planning document. It does not implement permissions. It defines what Phase 3 Frappe implementation must enforce.

The purpose is simple: the platform must never rely on the frontend alone to protect records, actions, payments, files, or admin functions. A hidden button is not a permission model. It is decorative security, which is security’s most embarrassing cousin.

---

## 2. Scope

This document applies to the following platform areas:

```text
Public website
Authentication and user context
Portal/dashboard
Membership
Decision Desk
DocuShare
Marketplace
Connectivity / NBN
Risk Advisor
The Fixer
Applications portal
Documents
Billing / payments
Notifications
File uploads
Admin operations
Tenant/account management
Audit logging
Workflow transitions
```

This document covers:

```text
- API permission checks
- service-layer permission checks
- Frappe DocType permissions
- Frappe workflow permissions
- tenant and owner filtering
- file and payment visibility
- admin action authority
- frontend permission hints
- QA/security requirements
```

This document does not define final field lists for every DocType. Those belong in:

```text
05-core-doctype-model.md
12-form-field-specifications.md
```

This document does not define final workflow transitions in full detail. Those belong in:

```text
06-workflow-state-standards.md
```

---

## 3. Related Phase 2 Documents

This permission model depends on:

```text
index.md
01-api-response-envelope-standard.md
02-naming-conventions.md
03-role-matrix.md
05-core-doctype-model.md
06-workflow-state-standards.md
07-error-catalogue.md
08-payment-state-model.md
09-upload-file-rules.md
14-notification-triggers.md
15-admin-actions.md
16-mock-to-real-api-map.md
```

The most important dependency is:

```text
03-role-matrix.md
```

The role matrix defines who exists. This permission model defines what those roles can actually do.

---

## 4. Permission Model Principles

All permission rules must follow these principles:

| Principle | Rule |
|---|---|
| Backend is authoritative | Permissions must be enforced by Frappe/backend, not only by frontend route guards. |
| Tenant isolation first | Customer records must be scoped to the correct tenant before any broader access is granted. |
| Least privilege | Users receive only the access required for their role, assignment, entitlement, and workflow state. |
| Role is not enough | Access must also consider owner, tenant, entitlement, assignment, workflow state, and visibility. |
| Admin is scoped | `RBP Admin` manages RBP platform operations but should not be treated as the same as Frappe `Administrator`. |
| Assignments matter | Advisors and support users should access assigned or queued records, not all records by default. |
| Files are protected records | File access must use explicit visibility rules and related-record checks. |
| Payment data is sensitive | Payment events and raw payloads must be restricted. |
| Auditability | Permission-sensitive actions must create audit records where appropriate. |
| Predictable errors | Permission failures must use the standard API response envelope and error catalogue. |

---

## 5. Permission Decision Formula

An action is allowed only when all required checks pass:

```text
Authentication
+ Role
+ Tenant
+ Ownership or assignment
+ Entitlement
+ Workflow state
+ File/payment/notification visibility
+ API method permission
+ DocType permission
= Action allowed
```

If any required check fails, the backend must deny the action.

Recommended internal decision flow:

```text
1. Resolve current user.
2. Resolve user roles.
3. Resolve tenant context.
4. Resolve target record.
5. Check record tenant.
6. Check ownership/team access.
7. Check assignment, if advisor/support flow.
8. Check entitlement, if product access depends on plan/app rights.
9. Check workflow state.
10. Check requested action.
11. Check field/file/payment visibility.
12. Return allowed or denied.
13. Record audit event if required.
```

---

## 6. Canonical Roles

The permission model uses the canonical roles from the role matrix:

```text
Guest
Website User
RBP Member
RBP Business Owner
RBP Team Member
RBP Advisor
RBP Marketplace Seller
RBP Marketplace Buyer
RBP Support Agent
RBP Admin
System Manager
Administrator
```

API role values:

```text
guest
website_user
rbp_member
rbp_business_owner
rbp_team_member
rbp_advisor
rbp_marketplace_seller
rbp_marketplace_buyer
rbp_support_agent
rbp_admin
system_manager
administrator
```

---

## 7. Permission Action Names

Permission actions must use these canonical action names:

```text
create
read
update
submit
cancel
delete
assign
approve
reject
archive
admin_review
request_more_information
attach_file
view_file
view_payment
manage_payment
view_notification
manage_notification
view_audit_log
manage_user
manage_role
manage_tenant
```

Backend helper functions should use `can_<action>_<resource>` or `can_<action>` patterns:

```python
can_create_request()
can_read_request()
can_update_request()
can_submit_request()
can_attach_file()
can_assign_advisor()
can_admin_review_request()
can_view_payment_event()
can_view_file_reference()
```

Do not create random action names such as:

```text
make
do_submit
adminThing
reviewNow
processStuff
```

Humanity has already suffered enough from vague verbs.

---

## 8. Core Permission Dimensions

## 8.1 Authentication

| User State | Access Rule |
|---|---|
| Guest | Public pages and explicitly whitelisted APIs only |
| Authenticated | Own context and role-authorised resources |
| Session expired | Deny protected actions with `not_authenticated` |
| Disabled user | Deny all non-public actions |
| Suspended user | Deny portal, submission, upload, and payment actions unless admin override applies |

Authentication must be checked before role, tenant, or ownership checks.

---

## 8.2 Role

Roles determine broad capability, but they do not grant final access alone.

Example:

```text
RBP Member can create a Decision Desk request only if:
- user is authenticated
- user has active member role
- user has required entitlement
- user belongs to a tenant
- target record belongs to their tenant or is being created for their tenant
```

---

## 8.3 Tenant

Tenant access is the central platform boundary.

A user may access tenant records only when:

```text
- they are the business owner of that tenant
- they are a team member of that tenant and the record is shared/allowed
- they created/own the record and the record belongs to that tenant
- they are assigned to the record as advisor/support
- they are RBP Admin, System Manager, or Administrator
```

Cross-tenant access must be denied by default.

---

## 8.4 Ownership

Ownership checks apply to customer-created records.

A user can usually read/update their own draft records if:

```text
- they created the record
- the record belongs to their tenant
- the record is in a workflow state that permits customer edits
```

Ownership alone does not permit admin actions, workflow overrides, payment changes, or access to another tenant.

---

## 8.5 Assignment

Assignment applies mainly to:

```text
RBP Advisor
RBP Support Agent
Admin operations
```

Advisor/support access should be granted only when:

```text
- the record is assigned to the user, or
- the user belongs to an authorised queue/team, or
- an RBP Admin grants explicit operational access
```

---

## 8.6 Entitlement

Entitlements determine whether a tenant/user can access a product or service.

Example entitlement keys:

```text
membership
decision_desk
docushare
marketplace
connectivity
risk_advisor
fixer
portal
billing
```

A user may have the right role but still lack entitlement.

Example:

```text
A user with RBP Member role may be blocked from premium Decision Desk requests if their plan does not include that entitlement.
```

Entitlements must be checked in the service layer before record creation or submission.

---

## 8.7 Workflow State

Workflow state controls what actions are permitted at a point in the record lifecycle.

Example:

```text
Draft:
  customer can update and submit

Submitted:
  customer usually cannot edit core fields
  admin/support can review

In Review:
  admin/support/advisor actions begin

Assigned:
  advisor can work on assigned record

Outcome Ready:
  customer can view outcome
  admin/advisor can close

Closed:
  edits are locked except admin/archive actions
```

---

## 8.8 Visibility

Visibility applies to files, notifications, payment records, audit logs, and internal notes.

Visibility must be explicit. If visibility is not set, default to the safest option.

Recommended defaults:

| Object | Default Visibility |
|---|---|
| Customer-created service record | Owner/tenant scoped |
| Uploaded file | `private_to_owner` |
| Advisor note | Assigned advisor/admin only |
| Admin note | Admin only |
| Payment event | Admin/business owner summary only |
| Raw payment payload | System Manager/Administrator only |
| Audit log | Admin/system only |
| Notification | Intended recipient/tenant/admin scoped |

---

## 9. Permission Enforcement Layers

Permission enforcement must happen across multiple layers.

## 9.1 Frontend Layer

Frontend may:

```text
- hide unavailable routes
- hide unavailable buttons
- disable actions
- show permission messages
- use user-context flags
- route unauthenticated users to login
```

Frontend must not be the final permission authority.

---

## 9.2 API Layer

API methods must:

```text
- validate session
- validate request arguments
- call service layer
- never trust frontend role claims
- never trust frontend tenant IDs without verification
- return standard response envelope
```

API module examples:

```text
rbp_app.api.membership
rbp_app.api.decision_desk
rbp_app.api.docushare
rbp_app.api.marketplace
rbp_app.api.connectivity
rbp_app.api.risk_advisor
rbp_app.api.fixer
rbp_app.api.portal
rbp_app.api.billing
rbp_app.api.notifications
```

---

## 9.3 Service Layer

Service layer must own business permission logic.

Service modules should check:

```text
- current user
- roles
- tenant
- ownership
- entitlement
- workflow state
- assignment
- file visibility
- payment visibility
- admin authority
```

Recommended service modules:

```text
rbp_app.services.tenancy
rbp_app.services.entitlements
rbp_app.services.files
rbp_app.services.billing
rbp_app.services.notifications
rbp_app.services.audit
```

---

## 9.4 Frappe DocType Layer

Frappe DocType permissions must provide baseline protection.

DocType-level permissions should define:

```text
- read
- write
- create
- delete
- submit
- cancel
- amend
- report
- export
- import
- print
- email
```

For sensitive objects, default to restrictive permissions and expand through service methods.

---

## 9.5 Frappe Workflow Layer

Workflow transitions must define which roles can move records between states.

Workflow permissions must be aligned with:

```text
06-workflow-state-standards.md
```

---

## 9.6 Query Filtering Layer

List APIs must filter records server-side.

Example list methods:

```text
list_my_requests
list_my_briefs
list_my_listings
list_my_orders
list_my_assessments
list_my_notifications
```

These methods must never return all records and expect frontend filtering.

---

- admin routes
- internal status fields
- workflow actions
```

If public form submission is allowed, it must create a restricted lead/intake record, not a fully privileged tenant/member record unless the signup/payment/onboarding process completes.

---

## 22. API Permission Rules

Every protected API endpoint must follow this pattern:

```text
1. Validate method/session.
2. Validate payload.
3. Resolve user context.
4. Resolve tenant context.
5. Check role/entitlement.
6. Check record access if record exists.
7. Check action permission.
8. Perform service operation.
9. Return standard response envelope.
```

## 22.1 Create APIs

Create APIs must check:

```text
- authenticated or explicitly public
- role can create this resource
- tenant can be resolved or created safely
- entitlement permits creation
- payload does not include forbidden fields
```

Example:

```text
POST /api/method/rbp_app.api.decision_desk.create_request
```

## 22.2 Update APIs

Update APIs must check:

```text
- user can read target record
- user can update target record
- record workflow state allows update
- payload fields are editable by this user
```

## 22.3 Submit APIs

Submit APIs must check:

```text
- user can read target record
- user can submit target record
- required fields are complete
- validation rules pass
- entitlement/payment requirements pass
- workflow transition is allowed
```

## 22.4 List APIs

List APIs must:

```text
- filter records server-side
- apply tenant, owner, assignment, and admin rules
- never expose records from other tenants
- return safe DTOs only
```

## 22.5 Admin APIs

Admin APIs must:

```text
- require admin/support/advisor authority as appropriate
- validate workflow state
- validate target DocType
- record audit log
- trigger notification if required
```

---

## 23. Frontend Permission Contract

The frontend should use a safe user context endpoint such as:

```text
GET /api/method/rbp_app.api.me.get_context
```

The response should include safe flags such as:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "can_access_portal": true,
    "can_access_admin": false,
    "can_manage_billing": true,
    "can_create_decision_desk_request": true,
    "can_create_marketplace_listing": false
  }
}
```

Frontend may use these flags to:

```text
- show/hide navigation
- show/hide CTAs
- disable buttons
- show upgrade prompts
- redirect unauthorised users
```

Frontend must still handle backend permission failures gracefully.

---

## 24. Standard Permission Error Responses

Permission failures must use the standard API envelope.

## 24.1 Not Authenticated

  "ok": false,
  "data": null,
  "message": "Authentication required",
  "errors": [

---

## 26. Frappe DocPerm Draft Guidance

Frappe DocType permissions should follow these broad defaults.

## 26.1 Customer Product Records

Examples:

```text
RBP Decision Desk Request
RBP Document Brief
RBP Connectivity Order
RBP Risk Assessment
RBP Fixer Request
```

Recommended baseline:

| Role | Read | Write | Create | Submit | Delete |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| RBP Member | Own/Tenant | Draft only | Yes | Yes | No |
| RBP Business Owner | Tenant | Draft only | Yes | Yes | No |
| RBP Team Member | Conditional | Conditional | Conditional | Conditional | No |
| RBP Advisor | Assigned | Advisor fields | No | Conditional | No |
| RBP Support Agent | Assigned/Queue | Support fields | Conditional | Conditional | No |
| RBP Admin | All | All | Yes | Yes | Conditional |
| System Manager | All | All | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## 26.2 Operational Records

Examples:

```text
RBP Payment Event
RBP Audit Log
RBP File Reference
RBP Notification
```

Recommended baseline:

| Role | Read | Write | Create | Delete |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Customer roles | Limited/safe only | No | No | No |
| Advisor | Assigned/safe only | Limited | No | No |
| Support Agent | Conditional | Conditional | Conditional | No |
| RBP Admin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Conditional |
| System Manager | Yes | Yes | Yes | Conditional |
| Administrator | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## 26.3 Configuration Records

Examples:

```text

RBP App Entitlement
RBP Onboarding Flow
RBP Onboarding Step
```

Recommended baseline:

| Role | Read | Write | Create | Delete |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Guest | Public read only where applicable | No | No | No |
| Customer roles | Read where applicable | No | No | No |
| RBP Admin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Conditional |
| System Manager | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Administrator | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

---

## 27. Permission Query Conditions

List views and APIs must enforce query-level restrictions.

Examples:

## 27.1 Customer List Query Logic

```text
Return records where:
- record.owner == current user
OR
- record.tenant in current_user_tenants AND role permits tenant visibility
```

## 27.2 Business Owner List Query Logic

```text
Return records where:
- record.tenant == business_owner_tenant
```

## 27.3 Team Member List Query Logic

```text
Return records where:
- record.tenant in user_tenants
AND record is shared with user or team policy permits access
```

## 27.4 Advisor List Query Logic

```text
Return records where:
- record.assigned_to == current user
OR
- record has advisor assignment entry for current user
```

## 27.5 Support Agent List Query Logic

```text
Return records where:
- record.assigned_to == current user
OR
- record is in a support queue assigned to the user
OR
- product-specific support permissions allow queue access
```

## 27.6 Admin List Query Logic

```text
Return RBP records according to admin role and operational filters.
```

No list endpoint should return unfiltered records and expect the frontend to behave like a responsible adult.

---

## 28. Security Requirements

The permission model must support these non-negotiable security requirements:

```text
No guest access to portal records.
No cross-tenant data leakage.
No unauthorised admin route access.
No client-side-only permission enforcement.
No customer-side mutation of internal/admin fields.
No unauthorised workflow transitions.
No unauthorised advisor access to unassigned records.
No marketplace seller approval of own listings.
No exposure of raw payment provider payloads to customer users.
No public exposure of private uploaded files.
No unauthorised visibility changes for files.
No deletion of audit logs by normal users.
```

---

## 30. Open Items for Final Phase 2 Lock

These items must be confirmed after Phase 1 UI/UX is complete:

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Final public form guest permissions | Draft | Depends on final UI flows |
| Final Team Member authority | Draft | Business rule required |
| Final entitlement-to-service mapping | Draft | Depends on membership packaging |
| Final marketplace guest/buyer rules | Draft | Depends on marketplace model |
| Final admin route list | Draft | Depends on admin UI completion |
| Final advisor workflow powers | Draft | Depends on service delivery process |
| Final support queue permissions | Draft | Depends on operations model |
| Final payment summary visibility | Draft | Depends on billing UX |
| Final file visibility defaults per product | Draft | Depends on upload/file contract |
| Final field-level permission map | Draft | Depends on form fields and DocTypes |
| Final notification visibility rules | Draft | Depends on trigger map |

---

## 31. Permission Model Acceptance Checklist

This document is ready for Phase 2 draft use when:

```text
All canonical roles are referenced.
All permission dimensions are defined.
Permission decision formula is documented.
Tenant isolation rules are documented.
Ownership, assignment, entitlement, workflow, and visibility checks are documented.
API permission rules are documented.
DocType permission assumptions are documented.
Field-level permission rules are documented.
File permission rules are documented.
Payment permission rules are documented.
Notification permission rules are documented.
Audit log permission rules are documented.
Admin action permission rules are documented.
Frontend permission contract is documented.
Standard permission error responses are documented.
Backend helper functions are proposed.
Frappe DocPerm guidance is included.
Permission query conditions are included.
Security requirements are included.
QA permission tests are included.
Open items are listed for Phase 1-dependent finalisation.
```

---

## 32. Phase 2 Sign-Off Criteria

This permission model can be signed off only when:

```text
Every Phase 1 screen has a defined access rule.
Every form has create/update/submit permission rules.
Every product flow has role, tenant, entitlement, and workflow checks.
Every DocType has read/write/create/submit/admin rules.
Every upload has visibility and access rules.
Every payment touchpoint has view/manage rules.
Every notification has recipient and visibility rules.
Every admin action has allowed roles and audit requirements.
Every mock API has a real endpoint with permission rules.
Every denied action has a standard error response.
QA tests cover tenant isolation and role enforcement.
```

Until then, this remains a draft.

Draft is not failure. Draft is just honesty in a file extension.

---

## 33. Final Rule

Permissions must be enforced where the data lives:

```text
Frappe/backend first.
Frontend second.
Documentation always.
```

The frontend may guide the user. The backend must protect the platform.
